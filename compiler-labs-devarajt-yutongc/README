          NILSSON INSTRUCTIONAL COMPUTER (NIC)


This directory contains a simulator of the Nilsson Instructional
Computer (NIS), an assembler (NAS), a manual, and example programs.

This project is based on an example from J. Glenn Brookshear. Computer
science: an overview, fifth edition, Addison-Wesley, 1997.


                  USING NIC AND NAS

To start the NIC, simply execute:

    java -jar nic.jar

and to compile an assembler file program.as into a corresponding
"executable" that can be loaded into the NIC, execute:

    java -jar nas.jar program.as

For full usage information, simply execute:

    java -jar nic.jar -h
    java -jar nas.jar -h


                 MANUAL AND EXAMPLES

The manual is found in doc/manual/manual.pdf and examples are found in
doc/examples.


                      BUILDING

If there is a mismatch between Java versions, then simply execute:

    clean
    make

Consult the Makefile for more information.


                  REMARKS ABOUT THE CODE

The code mostly adheres to traditional coding standards. The main
exception is that some variables are named in capitals to emphasize
that these correspond to constant values in physical computers.

The code is intentionally commented in an exaggerated way for didactic
purposes: to relate components of the NIC to parts of a physical
computer, to enable students to experiment and modify the software,
and as a general show case of carefully commented code.


                     FUTURE WORK

(1) The software can still be tested more carefully.

(2) Next version will allow "compiling" assembler to a Java file that
    can be run in Kattis.
